# Link

A Link takes the user to another page
or to a specific location on a page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Link Example"
/>

### Usage

Use a Link when you want the user to
navigate to another page, a specific
location on a page, or to download a document.


### Guidelines

- Link text should clearly describe where
the Link will take the user. It must answer,
“what will the user get when they interact
with this?”
- Do not use ambiguous Link text like “Click Here”.
- Don’t use a Link if you aren’t navigating
somewhere or downloading a document unless
the proper accessibility considerations are met.
- Links should primarily be part of a sentence
or near other text content.
- If used as a standalone call to action,
use first-person pronouns. For example: Use "Download My
Approval Letter," instead of "Download Your Approval Letter."

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Default Link

Default Link is the standard Link style and
should be used for most hyperlinks.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Default Link Example"
/>

### Simple Link

A more subtle Link style which looks more like regular body copy.
Use Simple Links in navigation, or in the header and footer of a page,
where context implies an ability to interact with the text.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--simple"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Simple Link Example"
/>

### Light Link

A link style for dark backgrounds.
Light links are mainly used in [Footer](/using-spark/components/footer).

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--light"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Light Link Example"
/>

### Icon with Text Link

This style combines an Icon with text.
This is most useful in menus or standalone
text and shouldn’t be used in a sentence.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--icon-with-text-link"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Icon with Text Link Example"
/>

### Disabled

Represents a Link that’s not currently available for interaction.
Using this variation helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand that the Link can’t be interacted with.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="link--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Link Example"
/>

## Anatomy

- A Link must contain text.
- A Link may contain an icon.

## Accessibility

- Avoid using Link to perform actions other than
navigation or accessing external resources, like
a file download. If you do, you must provide the
appropriate [accessibility controls](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).
