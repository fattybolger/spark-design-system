# Icon

Icons are visual symbols for communicating additional
meaning, status, and available actions.

<ComponentPreview
  allowScrolling
  componentName="icons--gallery"
  maxWidth="100%"
  maxHeight="1000px"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Icon Example"
/>

### Usage

Icons can be used to provide meaning and bring visual
interest to elements of a page. They can also be used to
indicate available actions and to clarify status or
give feedback.

### Guidelines

- Icons should only be sized to `16px`, `24px`, or `32px`.
- Icons should not be used in place of artwork or illustrations.
- If used as a clickable interaction with a text label,
use first-person pronouns. For example: Use "Download My
Approval Letter," instead of "Download Your Approval Letter."

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Accessibility

Icons are a great way to provide additional meaning for clients
with cognitive and visual disabilities. They should be
accompanied by text whenever possible.
