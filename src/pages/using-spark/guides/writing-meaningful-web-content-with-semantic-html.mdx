  Writing Meaningful Web Content with Semantic HTML
</h1>

Typically, in a word document, writers bold or italicize text to add emphasis to the copy.

When producing web content, **HTML elements** define the structure, purpose and intended meaning of a page's web content.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

## Main Takeaways

- Use HTML elements to define the structure and meaning of a web page's content to make it easier for users to understand.
- Know the purpose of each element to understand when to use it and to ensure the content can be accessed by assistive technologies.
- Use the correct element to ensure the content communicates the intended meaning.

Here are some benefits of using semantic HTML:

- It allows UX writers and developers to add meaning to content so search engines, screen readers and web browsers can understand it.
- It improves user experience. It's easier for engineers to understand and to develop with.
- It helps create faster, responsive, and better mobile user experiences. It's easier to make responsive, have reduced file size, and load faster.
- It helps web pages get better rankings. Search engines give more importance to those that have them.

## HTML Elements

HTML elements wrap content and describe meaning, structure, or context to web browsers, developers, and assistive technologies.

> For more information, visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"> Mozilla's Developer Documentation - HTML elements</a>.

As a UX Writer, it's important to:

- **Understand** what is the purpose of the enclosed text.
- **Know** what element to use depending on the purpose of the text.
- **Ensure** we are communicating the intended meaning of the enclosed text to the users.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

### Creating Elements Using Tags

Use **HTML tags** to create an element. These tags represent the start and end of a piece of content.

An element consists of three main parts:

- An **opening tag** that represents the start of the paragraph element.
- **Content** within the tags.
- A **closing tag** that represents where the element ends.

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Example</h3>

```
<p>Download the Rocket Homes mobile application on your mobile device to start looking for your dream home.</p>
```

- **The opening tag** `<p>`represents the start of the paragraph element.
- **The content** is the enclosed text inside `<p></p>` paragraph the tags: <i>"Download the Rocket..."</i>
- **The closing tag** `</p>` represents where the paragraph element ends.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

### Common HTML Elements

> As a general rule, avoid using **bold** or **italic** elements because they do not add semantic meaning.

- The **strong element** `<strong></strong>`, gives extra importance to the element's contents.
- The **emphasis element** `<em></em>`, gives a stressed emphasis to the element's contents.
- The **bold element** `<b></b>` , draws attention to the element's contents, without extra importance.
- The **italic or idiomatic text element** `<i></i>`, defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

## Semantic Elements

When web elements are meaningful and contextual, that means it's **semantic**. Semantic elements inform assistive technologies such as screen readers of an emphasis that might not be visually accessible to all users.

> Do not rely on HTML to create a visual change, collaborate with developers to correctly emphasize content.

Use the strong and the emphasis elements to add semantic meaning.

- [The Strong Element](#the-strong-element)
- [The Emphasis Element](#the-emphasis-element)

To view a list of all the HTML elements available to add semantic meaning to copy, refer to [MDN’s Semantic element list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#inline_text_semantics).

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

### The Strong Element

The <strong>strong element</strong> indicates strong importance, seriousness, or urgency of the enclosed text inside the `<strong></strong>` tags.

> By default web browsers, render the contents inside strong tags in **bold type**.

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Usage</h3>

- Referencing the name of a page
- Representing strong importance of it's contents
- Adding importance or urgency to pieces of a sentence

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Examples</h3>

- Check your **To Do List** items for new tasks.
  - Check your `<strong>To Do List</strong>` items for new tasks.
- You can change your communication preferences on **My Profile**.
  - You can change your communication preferences on `<strong>My Profile</strong>`.
- **Your payment is due** on September 22, 2021.
  - `<strong>Your payment is due</strong>` on September 22, 2021.
- Remember to bring your **driver’s license** to your closing appointment.
  - Remember to bring your `<strong>driver’s license</strong>` to your closing appointment.

### Strong vs Bold vs CSS Styling

> The **bold element**, **italic element** and **CSS styling** are purely presentational.

- Use the **strong element** `<strong></strong>` to communicate importance or urgency.
- Use the <b>bold element</b> `<b></b>` to bring attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
  - Use for:
    - Drawing the reader's attention to the elements contents, which aren't of special importance
    - Keywords in a summary and for product names in a review
- Use **CSS** (Cascade Styling Sheet) to style or decorate text. CSS styling **does not** add semantic meaning to content, unlike the strong element.
  - For example, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight"> font-weight style property</a> adds weight to text, making it appear bolder.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mvn" />

### The Emphasis Element

Use the **emphasis** element to give "stressed emphasis" to the enclosed text inside the `<em></em>` tags, in the same way verbal stress works.

- By default, web browsers render the contents inside the emphasis tags as <i>italic type.</i>

- A screen reader will pronounce the words inside the **emphasis** element `<em></em>` tags with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

> As a UX Writer, it is important to know when to apply **emphasis** to text because it can **change the meaning** of the sentence.

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Usage</h3>

- Words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text.
  - For example: Our family <em>loves</em> spending summers on the beach.
- Changing the meaning of a sentence.
  - For example: We found the perfect house, let's put an offer <em>
    now
      </em>!
- Referencing a specific instance of microcopy within the web page that users can take action on.
  - For example: <em>
    Find Brokers Near Me
      </em> to connect with a broker in your community.

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Examples</h3>

- Sort by <em>Submitted</em> to see the loans you’ve already completed.
  - Sort by `<em>Submitted</em>` to see the loans you’ve already completed.
- Select <em>I don’t have a preference </em> from the dropdown if you change your mind.
  - Select `<em>I don’t have a preference </em>` from the dropdown if you change your mind.

### Emphasis vs Italic

- Use the **emphasis element** `<em></em>` to indicate stress emphasis.
- Use the **italic element** `<i></i>` for text that is set off from the normal prose, like an alternate tone or mood.
  - Use for:
    - Technical terms
    - Transliterations
    - Taxonomical designations, like: "Homo Sapiens"

## Accessibility

Use semantic HTML to ensure digital experiences are inclusive to all users and accessible by assistive technologies.

Our guides are not all-inclusive. Refer to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1, Level AA)- Semantic Elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-html51-20161101/dom.html#elements) for more insights.
