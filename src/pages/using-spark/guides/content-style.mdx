## Capitalization

Use for visual presentation of pieces of text to make it easy for users to read.

> As a general rule, use **start case** for **headers**, use either **start case** or **sentence case** for **dropdown options** and **labels**, depending on the context.

### Start Case

Capitalize the first letter of each word, regardless of length or part of speech. When using start case, avoid using end punctuation other than question marks.

<h3 class="sprk-b-TypeDisplayFour sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure">Usage</h3>

- Headers that are descriptive or functional
- All subheads regardless of whether the primary header is title or sentence case
- All buttons labels (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Buttons)
- Menu items
- Chart and table headers
- Referring to the name of a page

- Emotional and Impactful headers
- Special instances, where there may be two primary headers on a page

- When quotation marks are needed in headlines, subheads and email subject lines, use **single** quotation marks.
