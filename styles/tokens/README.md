# Design Tokens

Our Design Tokens are a catalog from which we base all our 
visual and branding choices. It's a central database of our core style attributes.

These tokens describe branding decisions in color, typography, spacing, sizing, and much more.

Design Tokens are a future-friendly way to create visual consistency between platforms.
